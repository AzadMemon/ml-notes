    "Unlike linear regression, where we predict a continuous variable with bounds determined by the specific problem, the logistic model predicts a probability (therefore bounded between 0 and 1). We can then set a cutoff point (say 0.5). If our logistic regression predicts a value above 0.5, we map it to 1 (e.g. has disease) otherwise we map it to 0 (e.g. does not have disease)."
