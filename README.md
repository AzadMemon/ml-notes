For anyone else who lands here:

This is a collection of my notes. These are not intended to help others understand content and therefore are not thorough. I've added links to content that explain certain concepts far better than I can. This also helps me avoid having to write in latex. I'll update these notes as I feel necessary.

Todo:
*ROC AUC
*Logistic Regression
*Cross-Entropy Loss Function
*PCA
*SVM
*Decision Trees
*GBC


Questions:
1. How do we decide the right lambda for regularization (cross validation?)
2. How do we decide the learning parameter for gradient descent?

Notes:
1. I'll have to come back to Bayesian vs Frequentist far far later in the future
