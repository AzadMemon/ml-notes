For anyone else who lands here:

This is a collection of my notes. These are not intended to help others understand content and therefore are not thorough. I've added links to content that explain certain concepts far better than I can. This also helps me avoid having to write in latex. I'll update these notes as I feel necessary.

Todo:
*Logistic Regression
*PCA
*SVM
*Decision Trees
