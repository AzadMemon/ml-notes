For anyone else who lands here:

This is a collection of my notes. These are not intended to help others understand content and therefore are not thorough. I've added links to content that explain certain concepts far better than I can. This also helps me avoid having to write in latex. I'll update these notes as I feel necessary.

Todo:
*Newton's Method
*Cross Validation
*Logistic Regression
*PCA
*SVM
*Decision Trees
*GBC

Done:
*Linear Regression

Questions:
1. How do we decide the right lambda for regularization
2. How do we decide the learning parameter for gradient descent
